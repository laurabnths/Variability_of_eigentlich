# Variability_of_eigentlich
Data collection files of the MA-thesis "The Variability of German eigentlich".

The CSV-file "DF2.csv" contains the collected data and information of each eigentlich-variation found in the "Karl Eberhard Corpus" (Arnold & Tomaschek, 2016).
The Python-file "DataCollection_Eig.py" includes the code that was written to collect all the information for the dataframe in "DF2.csv". 
The models of the statistical analysis are included in the R-file "StatAnalysis_Eig.R". 


Abstract:
In 2018, Ernestus and Smith presented their findings on the variability of the Dutch
eigenlijk (actually) and the context in which this variability occurs in conversational
speech. This exceptional paper contributed to the knowledge of phonetic variation.
By replicating their analysis for the German equivalent eigentlich, the present paper
aims to contribute to that understanding as well.
The inspection of eigentlich shows a wide range of variability with almost 170 different
variations, including mono-, di-, and trisyllabic forms. By means of mixed-effects
modeling, the predictors of the word’s variation were analyzed. The tokens appear
shorter in duration and form with a higher speech rate, when being followed by
highly predictable words, and when being preceded by pauses or words of low surprisal.
Feature sharing and low paradigmatic uncertainty of the preceding word
accompanied less reduced forms. Overall, the findings emphasize the importance of
the context’s syntagmatic and paradigmatic probabilistic information for variation
processes, which supports the Smooth Signal Redundancy Hypothesis by Aylett and
Turk (2004). Moreover, the findings contribute to Kuperman et al. (2007)’s Paradig-
matic Signal Enhancement Hypothesis. The present study follows up on the results
of Ernestus and Smith (2018)’s study and agrees that more qualitative and quantitative
research on one word’s variability is necessary to extend our understanding
of the phenomenon and of what is stored in the mental lexicon.
