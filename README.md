# Variability_of_eigentlich
Files of data collection for the MA-thesis "The Variability of German eigentlich"

The CSV-file "DF2.csv" contains the collected data and information of each eigentlich-variation in the "Karl Eberhard Corpus" (Arnold & Tomaschek, 2016).
The second CSV-file called "Variations.csv" includes only the data on the 168 variations of eigentlich and their amount of surprisal as well as their uncertainty (in the eigentlich-paradigm of variations). 
The Python-file "A.py" includes the code that was written to collect all the information of the table in "DF2". 
The models of the statistical analysis are included in the R-file "Analyse3.R".
