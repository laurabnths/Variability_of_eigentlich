# Variability_of_eigentlich
Data collection files of the MA-thesis "The Variability of German eigentlich".

The CSV-file "DF2.csv" contains the collected data and information of each eigentlich-variation found in the "Karl Eberhard Corpus" (Arnold & Tomaschek, 2016).
The Python-file "DataCollection_Eig.py" includes the code that was written to collect all the information for the dataframe in "DF2.csv". 
The models of the statistical analysis are included in the R-file "StatAnalysis_Eig.R". 


Abstract:
In 2018, Ernestus and Smith published their outstanding research on the variability of the discourse marker "eigenlijk" (actually) and the context in which it occurs in conversational Dutch. By replicating their analysis for the German equivalent "eigentlich", the present paper aims to contribute to the understanding of variation in speech production.
The inspection of eigentlich’s variability shows a wide range of variability with almost 170 different variations ranging from mono- to trisyllabic forms. By means ofmixed-effects modeling, the predictors of the word’s variation were analyzed. The tokens tended to be shorter in duration and form at higher speech rates, when being followed by highly predictable words, and when being preceded by pauses or words of low surprisal. Feature sharing and low paradigmatic uncertainty accompanied less reduced forms.
Overall, the findings emphasize the importance of the context’s probabilistic information, which supports the Smooth Signal Redundancy Hypothesis by Aylett and Turk (2004). Moreover, the findings also indicate that paradigmatic uncertainty has an effect on the word’s variability, which contributes to Kuperman et al. (2007)’s Paradigmatic Signal Enhancement Hypothesis. The present study follows up on Ernestus and Smith (2018)’study and agrees that more qualitative and quantitative research on one word’s variability is necessary to extend our understanding of the phenomenon and of what is stored in the mental lexicon.
